# Code organization 
Files are organized into four main directories:

### src 
Contains the main Matlab files used to create figures

Organized in Figures

### utils 
Contains various Matlab functions needed across main scripts

### data 
Contains .mat files generated by scripts in src

Organized in Figures

### Filenames

These generaically take the form 

fig_[number]\_[row]_[col]

where [number] is the figure numbers and [row] and [col] are the row number and column number is multi-panel figures.
